modx-st2-tools
==============

Tools for a nice development in Sublime Text 2 with MODX CMF

It is a very-very alpha-release. But if you can help me, I wait your pull requests.

How install?
============

Go to your sublime direcority with packages (in Ubuntu `~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages`) and make clone of repository:
`git clone https://github.com/Alroniks/modx-st2-tools.git MODX`
and restart editor.

After you can set MODX syntax in View->Syntax->MODX.
